I completed the "Make your protype High-Fidelity" by imporving visual layout, designing a clean popup with styled elements, a two-column dropdown menu to enhance the users experience and not have to scroll down. 

I also completed the "Add a New Feature" by adding the favorite heart icon to the destinations cards, allowing the user to visually mark their favorite home.
